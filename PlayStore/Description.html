<u><b>AllTrans - Completely Translate Apps</b></u>
<br>a la Chrome translation of webpages, but for Android apps.
<br>
<br><u><b>What AllTrans does</b></u>
<br>It replaces <b>all text in an app</b> in a language from one language to another at runtime.
<br>Say for example an app you want to use is in German, but you know only English.
<br>Then whenever you open the required app, all the text in the app, <b>anywhere</b>, will be replaced by its English equivalents.
<br>This is something similar to the way Automatic Translate works in Chrome.
<br>
<br><u><b>Requirements</b></u>
<br>• Android 4.1 or later.
<br>• <b>Xposed Framework</b> or <b>VirtualXposed</b> installed and running.
<br><b>IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT XPOSED OR VIRTUALXPOSED IS, THIS APP IS NOT FOR YOU</b>
<br>
<br><u><b>How to use AllTrans</b></u>
<br>• In "Global Settings" tab, tap "Enter Microsoft/Yandex Subscription Key", input the corresponding key (see Instructions from below).

<br>• In the "Apps to Translate" tab, find the app you want to translate, click the checkbox next to it.
