<u><b>AllTrans - Completely Translate Apps</b></u>
<br>a la Chrome translation of webpages, but for Android apps.
<br>
<br><u><b>What AllTrans does</b></u>
<br>It replaces <b>all text in an app</b> in a language from one language to another at runtime.
<br>Say for example an app you want to use is in German, but you know only English.
<br>Then whenever you open the required app, all the text in the app, <b>anywhere</b>, will be replaced by its English equivalents.
<br>This is something similar to the way Automatic Translate works in Chrome.
<br>
<br><u><b>Requirements</b></u>
<br>? Android 5.0 or later.
<br>? <b>Root</b>. If you don't know what rooting is, this app won't work for you.
<br>? <b>Xposed Framework</b> installed and running.
<br>
<br><u><b>How to use AllTrans</b></u>
<br>? In "Global Settings" tab, enable "Use Yandex instead of Microsoft" if you want to use Yandex, else disable to use Microsoft.
<br>? In "Global Settings" tab, tap "Enter Microsoft/Yandex Subscription Key", input the corresponding key (see Instructions from below).

<br><u><b>TroubleShooting</b></u>
<br>? If no app is being translated, check your Microsoft/Yandex Subscription Key is correct.
<br>? If the translated app Force Closes/gets stuck on loading the first time after you start translating, click on the app in "Apps to translate" tab, and in "Other Settings" fill in "Delay Before Translating" to 2000.
<br>? If the translated app used to work fine, but now get stuck on starting, click on the app in "Apps to translate" tab, and click on "Click to Clear Translation Cache".
<br>? If some parts of the app are not being translated, click on the app in "Apps to translate" tab, and enable "Aggressive Mode".
<br>? If the app still Force Closes, disable translation for this app and contact me on the support thread on XDA - https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xposed-alltrans-completely-translate-t3539878
